The MIT License text appearing in this software is for

#### Add future update support

If you want to merge in future updates from this skeleton and have your own origin,
set up a separate branch to track this.

````bash
$ git remote rename origin upstream
$ git branch sass-package
$ git branch -u upstream/master sass-package
````

Then add an origin and push master

````bash
$ git remote add origin git@github.com:your_username/your-package.git
$ git push -u origin master
````

Now, the `sass-package` branch will pull changes from this project,
which you can then merge into your other branches.

If you later clone your repo you will need to create the update branch again.

````bash
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/razor-x/sass-package.git
$ git fetch upstream
$ git checkout -b sass-package upstream/master
````

## Installation

The recommended method is to add this as a dependency
to your project using [Bower] with

````bash
$ bower install --save sass-package
````

Alternatively, you can download a [release][Releases]
or clone the repository directly.
